I have to go to London tomorrow, so I thought I'd check how much the price of my normal rail ticket has increased in the new year. I didn't ask for the first class fare, but they told me it anyway. Having picked myself up off the floor, I'm a bit curious about that last digit. (Click on the image to see it more clearly.)
