It has been a while since I posted anything here, but I can't resist this one.

Let me just give three numbers.  The first two are:



	
  * **314**, the number of seats predicted for the largest party (Conservatives) in the UK House of Commons, at 10pm in Thursday (i.e., before even a single vote had been counted) from the exit poll commissioned jointly by broadcasters BBC, ITV and Sky.

	
  * **318**, the actual number of seats that were won by the Conservatives, now that all the votes have been counted.


That highly accurate prediction changed the whole story on election night: most of the pre-election voting intention polls had predicted a substantial Conservative majority.  (And certainly that's what Theresa May had expected to achieve when she made the mistake of calling a snap election, 3 years early.)  But the exit poll prediction made it pretty clear that the Conservatives would _either_ not achieve a majority (for which 326 seats would be needed), or _at best _would be returned with a very small majority such as the one they held before the election.  Media commentary turned quickly to how a government might be formed in the seemingly likely event of a hung Parliament, and what the future might be for Mrs May.  The financial markets moved quite substantially, too, in the moments after 10pm.

**For more details on the exit poll, its history, and the methods used to achieve that kind of predictive accuracy, see [Exit Polling Explained](http://warwick.ac.uk/exitpolling).**

The _third_ number I want to mention here is



	
  * **2.1.0**


That's the version of R that I had at the time of the 2005 General Election, when I completed the development of a fairly extensive set of R functions to use in connection with the exit poll (which at that time was done for BBC and ITV jointly).  Amazingly (to me!) the code that I wrote back in 2001–2005 still works fine.  My friend and former colleague [Jouni Kuha](http://stats.lse.ac.uk/kuha/), who stepped in as election-day statistician for the BBC when I gave it up after 2005, told me today that (with some tweaks, I presume!) it all works brilliantly still, as the basis for an extremely high-pressure data analysis on election day/night.  Very pleasing indeed; and strong testimony to the heroic efforts of the R Core Development Team, to keep everything stable with a view to the long term.

As suggested by that kind tweet reproduced above from the RSS President, David Spiegelhalter: Thursday's performance was quite a triumph for the practical art and science of Statistics.  [And I think I _am_ allowed to say this, since on this occasion I was not even there!  The credit for Thursday's work goes to Jouni Kuha, along with John Curtice, Steve Fisher and the rest of the [academic team of analysts](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-08/how-the-secret-general-election-2017-exit-poll-is-produced) who worked in the [secret exit-poll "bunker"](http://money.cnn.com/2017/06/08/news/exit-poll-uk-general-election/index.html) on 8 June.]
