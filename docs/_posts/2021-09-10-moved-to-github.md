title: 'This blog has now moved to GitHub'
---

After about 10 years of being hosted at wordpress.com, my personal blog "Let's Look at the Figures" is now moving to GitHub.  The reasons are various, including:

* I am already using _Jekyll_ with _GitHub Pages_ for my other blog at [alt-3.uk](https://alt-3.uk) (about maths and football leagues) --- and I like it! The simplicity of static pages maintained through a collection of plain-text files is very appealing to me.
* It is part of an effort to simplify my digital life, which has become overwhelmingly complicated in recent years.

The stable URL has now changed to [DavidFirth.github.io/blog](https://DavidFirth.github.io/blog). 

Some things that broke or are changed:

* The previous domain name _statgeek.net_ will soon cease to work. I can only apologise for any inconvenience that this causes to anyone. My recent retirement from paid work means that, while it's nice to have a custom domain for my blog, I can no longer thoil it.
* All comments made on old blog posts via wordpress.com are being left behind --- they are not being copied across to GitHub with the old blog posts. Likely that would be possible, but it does not seem easy.  Those old posts and comments will still be viewable at [statgeek.wordpress.com](https://statgeek.wordpress.com), for a while at least.
* From now on, commenting will not be available directly on blog entries themselves. I was getting a lot of spam comments, which was a pain. In future I will encourage people to comment/discuss posts with me on Twitter or by email, instead.

For now, the new blog site at [DavidFirth.github.io/blog](https://DavidFirth.github.io/blog) is rather "bare bones".  It is likely to stay that way; but I am of course open to suggestions for improvement!
