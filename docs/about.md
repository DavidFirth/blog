This blog's title _Let's Look at the Figures_ is inspired by the book of the same name written by Bartholomew and Bassett (Penguin, 1971) --- highly recommended if you can find a copy.

Blog entries will likely be few and far between.  I aim to post here only when I have something to say that might interest someone else.
